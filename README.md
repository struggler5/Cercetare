# idk what to call it so for now it's gonna be magic hand

> the arduino code is rough as I wrote it 3 years ago and so is the python (probably not very optimized)

> picture is  a schematic for the cable work for the arduino uno, but i'm sure it acan be done with other modules with small changes to the schematic but the pins are set in the arduino file so make sure to change that


# The main file CV-rec.py
- it does stuff
- it comunicates with arduino through the port witch should be change for each machine
- yes

  *I will not be updating it, let it die*
